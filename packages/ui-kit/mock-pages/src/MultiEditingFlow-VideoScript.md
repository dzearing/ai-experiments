# Multi Editing Flow - Video Script

## Single User Flow

---

### Slide 1: Initial Planning View

You've got an idea for real-time collaboration, but it's still just a concept.
The Plan Agent has helped break it down into phases on the right.
But you need to see what it actually looks like before moving forward.

---

### Slide 2: User Prompts for User Interface Mock

So you just ask: create a user interface mock for the landing page.
No need to open a separate design tool.
The agent's already working on it.

---

### Slide 3: Generating Mock Options

A new Landing Page tab appears, and four design directions are generating.
You're about to see options you wouldn't have thought of yourself.

---

### Slide 4: Mock Options Displayed

Four different takes on your landing page.
Option A: bold dark gradient with centered content.
Option B: clean split layout with stats.
Option C: modern with gradient accents and video space.
Option D: pure typography and whitespace.
Click any to preview, or tell the agent what's resonating.

---

### Slide 5: User Provides Feedback

You like the dark vibe from A and C, but prefer B's split layout.
You want it more minimal.
Just say that, and the agent starts blending your preferences.

---

### Slide 6: Regenerating Options

All four options are rebuilding based on your feedback.
You described a feeling, and it's becoming visuals.

---

### Slide 7: Regenerated Options

Every option now has the dark aesthetic, professional layout, and minimal feel you asked for.
You went from vague idea to polished directions in minutes.

## Multiplayer Collaboration Flow

### Slide 10: Collaboration Session Starts

You've invited Sarah, Mike, and Emma to review designs together.
Everyone sees the same options and can vote on favorites.

---

### Slide 11: Voting in Progress

Sarah and Mike upvoted Option A.
You voted for B.
Mike downvoted C with a note: too gradient-heavy.
You can see exactly who likes what.

### Slide 12: Team Feedback

The team's discussing tradeoffs.
Sarah suggests combining C's colors with B's professional layout.
Real design decisions happening through conversation.

---

### Slide 13: Agent Synthesizes Feedback

The agent's been listening.
Dark theme came up three times, professional layout twice.
It proposes combining the best of both and asks if you want to see it.

---

Everyone agrees.
The agent regenerates options with the team's feedback.
Option C now has four upvotes.
